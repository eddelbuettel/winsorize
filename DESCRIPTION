Description: Remove outliers by means of winsorization, ie shrinking outlying
 observations to the border of the main part of the data. This package started
 from the excellent robustHD package by Andreas Alfons in order to reduce the
 number dependent package being pulled in. We expect to update the code over 
 time.
